# Addition of two numbers using class and objects.
In this program you can see a C++ program to take 2 integers from users and create an object to calculate the sum of the numbers.
Here I have used access method public so that the data members and the functions can be accessed anywhere from the program.
I have used int data type for the function definition. It means that the function will return the value to the main funcion.
